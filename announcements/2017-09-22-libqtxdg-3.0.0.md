Today we've released version 3.0.0 of libqtxdg. This is the first needed piece
for the upcoming LXQt 0.12.0 release. The most visible and noteworthy changes are:
* qiconloader: Reuse Qt implementation
* xgiconloader: Reworks the unthemed/pixmap search
* xdgiconloader: Puts the hicolor at the end of the theme hierarchy
* xdgiconloader: Fix XdgIconLoaderEngine::actualSize()
* xdgiconloader: Support symbolic SVG icons
* xdgiconloader: Honor "FolowsColorScheme" theme hint

## Developers/Packagers

There are some changes packagers should take care of:
* Bump Major to 3, it might be that new packages names are needed
* This release adds a minimum Qt version requirement (5.6.1)
* This release also adds the development tool qtxdg-iconfinder - so maybe a new utils package is needed

A full list of changes is in the CHANGELOG file.
